    "When Neural Networks are used for image recognition, the features become different pixel intensity at certain points in the image. So for example, when recognizing a car, we may create a model with 2 key features, pixel 1 and pixel 2, where pixel 1 is representing a steering wheel and pixel 2 is showing a tire. We can plot the data points of various images on a plot just like any other data problem when we construct it as such. \n",

    "The problem with using a Logistic Regression model in this case is that your number of features becomes extremely large if you are looking at every pixel as a feature (about 3 million in the above example). Without using so many features it will be very difficult to get a good model fit, but with using Logistic Regression the algorithm is very efficient with so many features (remember we are using Gradient Descent and not Normal Equation with Logistic Regression).\n",

This idea is translatable to Machine Learning because the theory behind Neural Networks tries to mimic this in a way by learning to do various behaviors with a single model, i.e. letting the model learn itself."
