# machine-learning
This repo contains notebooks with detailed information on how various models work, their implementation, and their mathematical theory. There are also some use case examples that demonstrate how to implement certain models given a dataset.

This is mainly for my own studying and reference, but I continually add to this repo as I find more relevant material.
